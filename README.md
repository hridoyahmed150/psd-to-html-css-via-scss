# PSD to HTML, CSS via SCSS

## What we are building
* [Link to PSD](https://github.com/kingluddite/psd-to-html-css-via-scss/blob/master/img/bhs_mockup_approved1.psd)
## Description
* Practice project to show the conversion from PSD to modern HTML5 and CSS
  using Sass
  
## New Tools
Running Sass is a time saver but there is a better way and that is through
build tools like gulp and grunt. The newest and most build tool is webpack

## What webpack and our modern tooling does for us
* We installed the webpack dev server
  - This will auto refresh the page with changes and it's faster than
    live-reload because it is `virtual`
* We use git and github for version control
  - [git
